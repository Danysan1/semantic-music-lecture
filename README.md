# Semantic Web Technologies in the Musical Domain

This repository hosts the materials for the lecture on _Semantic Web Technologies in the Musical Domain_, specific for the course in _Knowledge Engineering_ at the Master in Artifical Intelligence (University of Bologna, a.y. 2022/2023). 

## Lecture Overview
The lecture on Semantic Web Technologies in the Musical Domain provides an introduction to the application of semantic technologies in the field of music. It covers various aspects related to music concepts, the representation of musical knowledge using ontologies, and the practical implementation of these concepts through real-world use cases.

The presentation and all the material presented in the lecture can be found in the [assets](./assets) folder.

Exercise Section
The exercise section of this repository is designed to provide hands-on experience with querying knowledge graphs in the musical domain. Specifically, the exercises focus on querying the knowledge graphs of two prominent use cases: ChoCo and Harmory. These exercises will enable you to gain practical insights into retrieving and manipulating musical data using semantic technologies.

All the material for the excercises can be found in the [exercise](./exercise) folder.

## How to Participate
To participate in the exercise section and present your outcomes, follow these steps:

- Fork this repository to create your own copy.
- Complete the exercises by querying the knowledge graphs of ChoCo and Harmory. Each query should be presented in a separate `.sparql` file. Name it as a `query_<number>-<group_name>.sparql`
- Create a pull request to submit your changes to this repository.
- In the pull request, provide a detailed explanation of the query produced.
- Feel free to include additional information, such as bug reports, suggestions and other feedbacks.
