# Harmory Query Exercise

In this exercise, we will be exploring the Harmory knowledge graph (KG) through SPARQL queries. Harmory, short for Harmonic Memory, is a collection of segmented chord sequences linked via similarity values.

## Competency Questions (CQs)

In the following table, you can find a few predefined CQs:

| How many tracks does the dataset contain?                       | For a given pattern, which are the tracks (titles, artists and genres) in which the pattern can be found?                      |
| What is the musical work containing more segments?              | Which harmonic patterns are used in “Michelle” by The Beatles, but also in a classical composition?            |
| What is the most common pattern?                                | Given a chord sequence, which are its variations, and which tracks these variations belong to? |
| What is the most common segment?                                | Given a track, which tracks contain patterns with a distance of less than 0.2?                    |
| How many patterns does the dataset contain?                     | Given a track, which is the most similar track considering the average similarity of all its patterns?    |
